# ENGO551_Lab4

In this lab majority of the code was based on the web form provided in the lab file.
As it can be seen in the video, the code is functional and there is access to the MQTTX, but the share location feature is not fully implemented.
The code does have accesss to the location as it will be seen, but getting this location over does not seem to work.
Either than that the code has no issues.
